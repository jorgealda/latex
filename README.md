## Zaragoza theme
Beamer offers lots of advantages if you want to make a scientific presentation. 
But let's be honest: Beamer themes are awfully boring. Luckily enough, I stumbled upon a fantastic theme called Torino, by Marco Barisione. 
It didn't fit all my needs, so I made some tweaks. And Zaragoza theme was born!

Still under development, so use it with caution.
